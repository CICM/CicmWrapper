Cicm Wrapper aims to facilitate the creation of objects for Pure Data. The main axis is the creation of graphical user interfaces and signal processing. The Cream Library (Chocolate, Coffee and Caramel) is a set of externals, not essential but very useful, created with the Cicm Wrapper.

To install the Cream Library, copy the "CreamLibrary" folders in your Pd extra folder and add the startup flag "c.library". 
On Linux and Mac Os, the "misc" subfolder will be added to your preference paths automatically. 
On Windows you have to do it yourself or to copy the content of the "misc" folder into the "CreamLibrary" folder. 
On Linux 32 bits, you have to replace the "c.library.pd_linux" in the CreamLibrary folder by the one that is in the "Linux32" subfolder.

This libraries should work for Pd 0.43 and higher - Mac Os, Windows and Linux. 
Tested with PD Extended 0.43.4 and PD 0.45.3 - Max Os 10.8.5, Windows 7, Ubuntu 13.10
