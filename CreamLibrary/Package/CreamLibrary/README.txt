Cicm Wrapper aims to facilitate the creation of objects for Pure Data. The main axis is the creation of graphical user interfaces and signal processing. The Cream Library (Chocolate, Coffee and Caramel) is a set of externals, not essential but very useful, created with the Cicm Wrapper.

Installation :
Copy the "CreamLibrary" folder in your Pure Data "package" folder and add "c.library" in startup preferences. You can also copy the "CreamLibrary" folder in another folder than the default package folder, then you have to add this folder in the path preferences and add "CreamLibrary/c.library" in the startup preferences. For PD-Extented, use the startup flags "-lib c.library" or "-lib CreamLibrary/c.library". 

On Linux 32 bits, you have to replace the "c.library.pd_linux" in the CreamLibrary folder by the one that is in the "Linux32" subfolder.

This libraries should work for Pd 0.43 and higher - Mac Os, Windows and Linux. 
Tested with PD Extended 0.43.4 and PD 0.45.3 - Max Os 10.8.5, Windows 7, Ubuntu 13.10
