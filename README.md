##### Presentation

The CICM wrapper is a C/TK library that aims to facilitate the creation of objects for Pure Data. One of the main axis is the creation of graphical user interfaces and signal processing.

- The inlets/outlets are automatically generated.
- The background color, border size, border color are easy to set.
- The GUI objects can be resized with click and drag.
- The graphics API use layers and "clip" the drawings within the box boundaries.
- The attributes (size, colors, values and whatever you want) are saved with the patch.
- The inlets/outlets are dynamics.
- The management of mouse motion and keys is simplified.
- The convertion from Max to Pd and from Pd to Max 6 is really easy.
and a lot of other stuff, I can't enumerate everything !
